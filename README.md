# Analog Clock
This Project has been development in Xcode 10.1 and Swift v4.2. I have referred this code from this link http://www.knowstack.com/coreanimation-analog-clock/. 
But the code available in that link is in Objective-C and also for Mac Programming. So, I tried to convert it for Swift v4.2.
