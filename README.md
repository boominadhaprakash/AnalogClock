# AnalogClock
This Project has been development in Xcode 8.2.1 and Swift v3.0. I have referred this code from this link http://www.knowstack.com/coreanimation-analog-clock/. 
But the code available in that link is in Objective-C and also for Mac Programming. So, I tried to convert it for Swift v3.0.
